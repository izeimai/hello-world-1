# hello-world
I am following a tutorial because I think it is going to be beneficial in the long run.  I want to be methodical about this coding ting.  I do not want to skip ahead where I think I can because ultimately that may come back to bite me in the ass.
Look I am just following instructions here but I see no need to write anything about myself actually of meaning or personal.  I mean, maybe we will look back on this public file and nerd out when I'm a big successful developer guy but for now cool your jets.
